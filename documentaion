📄 Docker Documentation for News Aggregator App
This document provides instructions on how to run the frontend application inside a Docker container.

📝 Prerequisites
Before running the project in Docker, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker (Latest version recommended)
🚀 Steps to Run the Project in Docker
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
If you haven’t already, clone the project from your repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-aggregator.git
cd news-aggregator
2️⃣ Build the Docker Image
Run the following command inside the project directory to build the Docker image:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker build -t news-aggregator .
🔹 What this does:

-t news-aggregator → Tags the image as news-aggregator.
. → Uses the current directory (Dockerfile should be in the root).
3️⃣ Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, start the container using:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name news-aggregator-container news-aggregator
🔹 What this does:

-p 3000:3000 → Maps port 3000 from the container to localhost:3000.
--name news-aggregator-container → Names the container for easy reference.
news-aggregator → The Docker image name created in step 2.
4️⃣ Access the Application
Once the container is running, open your browser and go to:
🔗 http://localhost:3000

📌 Additional Docker Commands

docker stop news-aggregator-container
Remove the Container
sh
Copy
Edit
docker rm news-aggregator-container

🔧 Troubleshooting
Error: Port 3000 is already in use
Stop any process using port 3000:
sh
Copy
Edit
sudo lsof -i :3000
sudo kill -9 <PID>
Or run the container on a different port:
sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8080:3000 --name news-aggregator-container news-aggregator
Then access it at http://localhost:8080.
Rebuild the Docker Image (If Code Changes)
If you modify the code and want to apply changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker build --no-cache -t news-aggregator .
